# TODO

## Essential
* Download SB3 file
* Parse, preferably store data in YAML format
* Parse HTML file
* Display stage, blocks
* * No Blockly, need to write own script
  *  * Maybe coding area could use Python?
* Deal with audio
* Add checker to ensure max limits
* ** COMPILE **

## Would Be Nice

* Connect to GitHub Repo
* Allow export as SB3 file(versus SB3PP file(?))

## Unneeded
