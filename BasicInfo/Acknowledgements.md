# Essential Credits 
Scratch++ is a rewrite of [Scratch,](https://scratch.mit.edu) a project originally by Life Long Kindergarten, from [MIT.](https://mit.edu)  

Scratch was originally developed by a team led by [Mitch Resnick](https://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/)  

To deal with JSON files, which the [SB3](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Scratch_File_Format) file uses, Scratch++ uses [Neils Lohmann's](https://nlohmann.me) JSON [Library](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)  

To handle requests, Scratch++ uses [Yhirose's](https://github.com/yhirose) C++ HTTP [library](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib)
